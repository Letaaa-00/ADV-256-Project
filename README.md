This repository is for recording my Adv-interactive prototype project.  
## Project 1 Hogwarts House Sorting Hat (lighting)

I designed my first project based on the impressive Sorting Hat from the Harry Potter movies. 
People wear it, and it flashes the colors representing the different house, and then randomly assigns you to one.
