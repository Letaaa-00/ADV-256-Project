## Project 2 Light and Shadow adventure
Using a light sensor, a black-and-white forest scene is designed, 
and when the player shines a flashlight, 
the terrain or path will be displayed on the screen. 
Monsters will appear during the search process, and the light must be turned

### Part 1 - Introduction of my initial project idea
Here is my first two ideation of sketchs:  

This project uses the M5Stack development board and a reflective sensor as the game's control. It also controls the brightness of the lantern and the light and dark of the environment in which the little man in the game is located. When facing a monster, you need to turn off the light and wait three seconds to avoid the monster. The game is won or lost by avoiding the monster.

### Part 2 - Process of making lanterns
I created a lantern model in Rhino and printed it with translucent material. 
The lantern design uses a geometric pattern, which is then made into a three-dimensional pattern 
and applied to the simple lantern shape I designed to reflect light in different directions (in total darkness). 
I also created a stick to hold it up, and I hid the M5 lite, LED and extension inside the lantern.

Here is the list of all the separate hardware components used in Hogwarts House Sorting Hat
* ATOM Lite: The core of the project, it controls the input/output and runs the program. It reads the circuit's state and controls the LEDs.  
* Extention of ATOM: In order to additional input/output ports and enhancing connectivity options.  
* RGB light stripe:  Represent the Hogwarts houses with different colors (red, blue, yellow, and green). They are connected to G2 and provide visual feedback during the sorting process.  
* Reflective Sensor: Controls the brightness of a physical lantern and adjusts game lighting based on ambient light, enhancing immersion by syncing physical and digital lighting. 

### Part 4 - How my interactive prototype should behave

Allow me explain the inputs/outputs used in my code and how they affect the behavior of the lantern in Thonny.
* The code imports necessary modules, including the M5 library, time library, m5utils, and hardware module, enabling interaction with the M5Stack board and connected hardware components.
```Python
import os, sys, io
import M5
from M5 import 
import time
import m5utils
from hardware import 

```  

* An infinite while loop is used to continuously update the M5Stack's status (M5.update()), read sensor data, and control the RGB light strip's brightness. time.sleep_ms(50) adds a delay to control the loopâ€™s execution frequency.
```Python
while True:
    M5.update()
    ...
    time.sleep_ms(50)
```  

* The set_brightness(scaled_val) function is called to apply the remapped brightness value to the RGB light strip.
* print(scaled_val) outputs the brightness value to the console for debugging and monitoring.
```Python
set_brightness(scaled_val)
print(scaled_val)

```

* RGB(io=38, n=30, type="SK6812") configures an RGB light strip connected to Pin 38, with 30 LEDs of type SK6812.
* ADC(Pin(7), atten=ADC.ATTN_11DB) sets up the ADC on Pin 7 with an attenuation setting of 11DB, increasing the ADC's input range.
```Python
rgb2 = RGB(io=38, n=30, type="SK6812")
adc = ADC(Pin(7), atten=ADC.ATTN_11DB)
```

* The set_brightness(brightness) function calculates the RGB color value for the light strip based on the brightness parameter.
* (brightness << 16) | (brightness << 8) | brightness converts the brightness level into an RGB color value representing white (R=G=B) with varying intensity.
* rgb2.fill_color(rgb_color) applies the computed color value to the entire RGB strip.

```Python
def set_brightness(brightness):
    rgb_color = (brightness << 16) | (brightness << 8) | brightness  # White with varying brightness
    rgb2.fill_color(rgb_color)

```
### Part 4 - How my interactive prototype should behave

Allow me explain the inputs/outputs used in my code and how they affect the behavior of in Digital Game.
* Imports the p5.js library for drawing and handling graphics (aliased as p5) and document from JavaScript, allowing access to HTML elements for interaction.
```Python
import js as p5
from js import document
```

* Initializes variables for different images used in the game, such as background_img, avatar_img, and several monster images.
```Python
# Load images
background_img = None
avatar_img = None
monster1_img = None
monster2_img = None
monster3_img = None
achieve_img = None
win_img = None

```

* Defines various game-related variables: monster_x for monster position, sensor_value for reading sensor input, brightness for screen brightness, game_state to track the game's status, and bg_x and bg_scale for handling background movement and scaling.

```Python
# Variables
monster_x = 500
sensor_value = 0
brightness = 255
monster_timer = 0
game_state = "play"  # states: play, game_over, win
monster_index = 0
monsters = []  # List to store the monster images
bg_x = 0  # For background movement
bg_scale = 1.5  # Scale factor for the background

```


* Loads all image assets needed for the game, such as the background, avatar, and monster images, storing them as global variables.

```Python
def preload():
    global background_img, avatar_img, monster1_img, monster2_img, monster3_img, achieve_img, win_img, monsters
    background_img = p5.loadImage("Background.png")
    avatar_img = p5.loadImage("Avatar.png")
    monster1_img = p5.loadImage("Monster1.png")
    monster2_img = p5.loadImage("Monster2.png")
    monster3_img = p5.loadImage("Monster3.png")
    achieve_img = p5.loadImage("achieve.png")
    win_img = p5.loadImage("win.png")
    monsters = [monster1_img, monster2_img, monster3_img]  # Load monsters into list

```

* Sets up the game by creating an 800x400 canvas and printing a message indicating that setup is complete.

```Python
def setup():
    p5.createCanvas(800, 400)  # Adjust canvas size
    print('Game setup complete')

```

* This function is called continuously to render the game frame-by-frame.

```Python
def draw():
    global monster_timer, sensor_value, brightness, game_state, monster_index, bg_x, monster_x
```


* Reads the value from a "data" HTML element (likely for a sensor) to adjust brightness, which then changes the background color accordingly.

```Python
    # Reading data from reflective sensor
    sensor_value = int(document.getElementById("data").innerText)
    brightness = int(sensor_value)
    
    # Adjust screen brightness
    p5.background(brightness)

```

* Moves the background to create a scrolling effect. When bg_x reaches a certain point, it resets to create a looped background.
```Python
       bg_x -= 10 * p5.deltaTime / 1000  # 10px per second movement
    if bg_x <= -background_img.width * bg_scale:  # Wrap background
        bg_x = 0
    
    # Scale and draw the background at its correct ratio
    p5.push()
    p5.scale(bg_scale)
    p5.image(background_img, bg_x / bg_scale, 200 / bg_scale)
    p5.image(background_img, (bg_x + background_img.width) / bg_scale, 200 / bg_scale)
    p5.pop()


```

* The game has three states: "play", "game_over", and "win". In "play" mode, the avatar and monsters are rendered, and game logic runs.
* Avatar Drawing: The avatar is displayed at a fixed position on the screen.
* Monster Logic: The monster moves horizontally. Every 10 seconds, it appears at a set position. Based on sensor_value, the game state changes to "game_over" or "win".
```Python
     if game_state == "play":
        # Avatar logic
        p5.image(avatar_img, 100, 240)
        
        # Monster logic (every 10 seconds)
        monster_timer += p5.deltaTime / 1000
        monster_x -= 20 * p5.deltaTime / 1000
        if monster_timer >= 10:
            p5.image(monster2_img, monster_x, p5.height - 350)  
        if monster_x <= 120 and sensor_value == 255:
            game_state = "game_over"
        if monster_x <= 120 and sensor_value == 12:
            game_state = "win"


```


* Displays different text and background colors based on whether the player has won or lost.
```Python
     elif game_state == "game_over":
        p5.background(0)  # Black screen
        p5.fill(255)  # White text
        p5.textSize(50)
        p5.textAlign(p5.CENTER, p5.CENTER)
        p5.text("You've been captured ", p5.width / 2, p5.height / 3)
        p5.text("by monster ", p5.width / 2, p5.height /2 )

    elif game_state == "win":
        p5.background(0)
        p5.fill(255)
        p5.textSize(50)
        p5.textAlign(p5.CENTER, p5.CENTER)
        p5.text("You survived from monster ", p5.width / 2, p5.height /2 )

```

* This function calculates the distance between the avatar and a fixed point to check if they collide, indicating the player reached the achievement.
```Python
 def avatar_touches_achieve():
    # Check if avatar touches achievement
    return p5.dist(200, 200, 600, p5.height - 150) < 50

```
